# TriviaGame


Overview

In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

Remember

You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of Saturday's class.

Before You Begin

Create a GitHub repo called TriviaGame, then clone the repo to your computer.

Create a file inside of the TriviaGame folder called index.html. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.

Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.
Create a folder inside of the TriviaGame folder called assets.

Inside assets, create three folders: css, javascript, images
In your css folder, create a style.css file.
In your javascript folder, create an app.js file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
In your images folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.
Choose a game to build from your options below.

Option One: Basic Quiz (Timed Form)

Basic

Click Here to Watch the Demo.

You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.

The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)

Advanced

Click Here to Watch the demo.

You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

A Few Last Notes

Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get creative!

If you get stuck anywhere in this assignment, remember to talk to a TA or instructor for support.

Good Luck!
